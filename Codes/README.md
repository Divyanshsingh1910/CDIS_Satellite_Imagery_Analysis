**extractsatelliteimages.ipynb** - Is a codefile in which we need to input a csv with lat, long, and image labels and will extract satellite images corresponding to that latitude and longitude. 

**k_nearest_code_old.ipynb** - Is a codefile through which we are extracting k- nearest neighbours using OSM features. We just need to change the values of variables to output different k nearest places.
